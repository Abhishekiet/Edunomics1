/Ans: Nearly everything is object in JavaScript
    • Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    • Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    • Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    • Dates are always objects
    • Maths are always objects
    • Regular expressions are always objects
    • Arrays are always objects
    • Functions are always objects
    • Objects are always objects
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.
Example //
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>JavaScript Object</p>

<p iabh"></p>

<script>
var charac = {
  firstName : "abhishek",
  lastName  : "Dameria",
  age     : 22,
};

document.getElementById("abh").innerHTML = charac.firstName + " " + person.lastName;
</script>

</body>
</html>
